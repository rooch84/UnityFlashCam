Code by Chris Rooney

This is my first attempt at producing publically available project, so bare that
mind when you look through my code.  

First you need to install the Air application "FlashCam".  There is an air 
install file and a windows executable install in the FlashCam folder. 

Next, just run UnityFlashCam.exe, check the install path of FlashCam.exe and
Start. The folder itself is a Unity project folder with the script source. 

I have made this in Windows 7, so I'm not sure if the code to run external 
applications will run on MacOS or Linux. As a matter of fact, I'm not 100% sure how well Adobe Air is supported.
